## Hi, I’m Andi 👋

I’m an engineer who aspires to be a scientist. I work on multimodal AI, with a strong focus on vision-language models, speech systems, and efficient on-device inference.

I currently work at Hugging Face, where I lead our multimodal research and contribute to projects spanning:
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
- Speech-to-speech and conversational systems
- Multimodal research with an emphasis on efficiency and real-world deployment
- Robotics-facing AI systems

I enjoy building things that are both **technically solid** and **actually usable**, from research code to demos and production-ready tools.

### What you’ll find here
- Research prototypes and experimental ideas
- Open-source tools and demos
- Work around multimodal models, audio, and vision
- Occasional side projects

### Background
- PhD in applied machine learning (speech and generative models)
- Former senior ML engineer at Unity
- Interested in small, fast, and well-engineered models

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out.
